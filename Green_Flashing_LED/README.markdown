Prototype Engineering, LLC Netduino FPGA Shield Green LED Example
=================================================================

This is the source package for the Prototype Engineering FPGA shield Green Flashing LED example.

Overview
-------------------------

This simple example causes the green LED on the FPGA board to flash on and off with a period of roughly 1/4 second.  None of the GPIOs on the Netduino are forced or sensed; the Netduino is effectively unburdened by the shield's presence.  This project is primarily useful for debugging the bitstream loading process, and as a base project.
